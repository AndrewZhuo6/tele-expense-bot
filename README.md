# tele-expense-bot
The program use user's message to the telegram bot to log the user's expense or income.

I have this idea since I'm going to university, and I think it's good if I can track my own income and expense during my study. Just to make sure I don't overspend my money.

Here is how to use it:
Go to you telegram and search for BotFather, chat "/newbot" to the BotFather. Then, you will be guided to create a new bot. After successfully create a new bot, you will be given the bot's token. Alter the "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" value in token with your own bot's token. After that, the program is ready to go.
